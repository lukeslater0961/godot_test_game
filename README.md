My First Games and Projects with Godot
Welcome to the repository where I stash my initial games and projects developed using the Godot Engine. This repository serves as a collection of my learning journey and experimentation with game development. Here you'll find various small projects, prototypes, and experimental features that I've worked on to get familiar with the capabilities of Godot.

About the Repository
This repository contains my initial forays into game development using the Godot Engine. The projects here range from simple prototypes to more complex mini-games, each created to test different features and functionalities of the engine. The primary goal is to learn and experiment, so the projects may vary in completeness and polish.

Projects
Here is a list of some projects you'll find in this repository:

Pong Clone: A basic clone of the classic Pong game, created to understand the basics of 2D game development.
Platformer Prototype: A simple platformer game to experiment with physics, collisions, and character movement.
Top-Down Shooter: A top-down shooter game prototype to explore shooting mechanics, enemy AI, and level design.
Puzzle Game: A small puzzle game to test UI elements and game logic.
Each project is contained within its own directory with all the necessary assets, scripts, and scenes.
